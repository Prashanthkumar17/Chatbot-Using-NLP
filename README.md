# Chatbot
The purpose of the chatbot is to make a conversation between both humans and machine. Chatbots were initially made using the concepts of machine learning with Natural Language Processing (NLP) and it had some ﬂaws in it. In order to overcome those problems, we are using some deep learning techniques with NLP to create an advance chatbot. Chatbots are the latest technologies created for the modern world. Chatbots uses the concept of NLP to communicate and share data. The way they are trained and the methods that are implemented to make the conversation sensible and reasonable is stated. The machine has been trained with certain knowledge to ﬁgure out the sentences and deciding by its own to generate a response to answer a question. The response should be matching to the input sentence from user. From the input sentence, it will perform certain calculations to get the similarity of sentences. This paper provides an overview of some modern deep learning techniques that were used to build the chatbots. The methods of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Long short-term memory (LSTM) are implemented in our model to generate the outputs.
